Kindly begin by reviewing CHANGELOG.md and then, please take into account that the project is a social networking system, hence, there are multiple users involved. For the purpose of these reviews and evaluation, we will refer to User A as the person who does the activity (react, comment, post, etc) and User B as the recipient of these activities. To begin with, 

Let's proceed to edit_profile.php

This is a very sensitive file. Actually, this one is working perfectly already. I just want to modify the following:

1. It's not using the standard 3-column grid template that is being used universally in all other pages (with exception to view_profile.php since it's a stand-alone file that will be highly based on the data of edit_profile.php); and
2. It's not following the monochromatic blackish theme that's being implemented in the whole project. I get to see other colors here. I wanna change it.

Note:

The 3 column grid is being implemented in similar pages like "testimonials.php" where the right most side is fetching assets/add_ons.php and the left most column is from navigation.php --if I'm not mistaken for both. So, I'd like the current php content for this file be inside the main content of the 3 column grid. You may refer to dashboard.php, testimonials.php, or notifications.php as to how the 3-column grid is implemented.

Kindly fix and address these issues one by one, and do not assume that every modification you provide is already foolproof. It is essential to test it and record its performance in the @/CHANGELOG.md

# [2025-06-13] - Pre-Implementation Documentation for Tasks from TaskLog.md

## Task 1: Activity Feed - Testimonials
- **Diagnosis:** Testimonial activities are not showing in the sidebar Activity Feed. SQL/PHP/JS logic for testimonials is likely missing or broken in `api/add_ons_middle_element.php` and `api/add_ons_middle_element_html.php`.
- **Plan/Intended Fix:**
  - Add/restore a SQL block in `api/add_ons_middle_element.php` to fetch testimonial activities for the current user and their friends/followed users.
  - Map testimonial activity data in PHP for the frontend.
  - Add JS rendering logic for testimonial activities in `api/add_ons_middle_element_html.php`, with correct text for giver, receiver, and friends/followers.
  - Test to ensure all other activity types are not broken.
- **Expected Outcome:** Testimonials (given/received) appear in the activity feed with correct text for all user types.

# [2025-06-16] - Multi-Task Execution

## Task 1: Activity Feed - Testimonials
- **Review/Evaluate:** SQL UNION error due to mismatched columns in testimonials block.
- **Plan:** Align all SELECTs in UNION to have same columns/order. Add NULLs as needed.
- **Execution:** Updated Block 7 (testimonials) in api/add_ons_middle_element.php to match columns/order of Block 1.
- **Outcome:** Pending test after fix. If error persists, further review needed.

## Task 2: Newsfeed Media Display
- **Review/Evaluate:** Newsfeed still crops images, grid not working for multiple images.
- **Plan:** Inspect HTML output, ensure correct classes/structure, verify CSS loading.
- **Execution:** Inspected PHP/HTML output and CSS. Ensured correct classes/structure for media grid. CSS confirmed loaded.
- **Outcome:** Pending test after fix. If still broken, further review of PHP output and CSS specificity needed.

## Task 3: Share Button
- **Review/Evaluate:** Share button logs to console but does not open modal.
- **Plan:** Check modal HTML, verify JS selector/event handler, fix as needed.
- **Execution:** Verified modal exists in HTML, checked JS event handler, fixed selector if needed.
- **Outcome:** Pending test after fix. If still broken, further JS debug required.

# [2025-06-16] - Implementation of Activity Feed Testimonial Fix

## Task 1: Activity Feed - Testimonials
- **Changes Made:**
  - Updated SQL query in `api/add_ons_middle_element.php` to properly handle testimonial activities for:
    * Users who wrote testimonials
    * Users who received testimonials
    * Users who follow either the writer or recipient
  - Added LEFT JOINs with `friend_requests` table to check for connections with both writer and recipient
  - Updated WHERE clause to include all three visibility conditions
  - Added proper parameter bindings for the new conditions
- **Outcome:**
  * Activity Feed now correctly displays testimonial activities with appropriate text for each user type
  * Testimonial content is shown as a preview when available
  * Display format is consistent with other activity types
- **Status:** Implemented and functional

## Task 2: Newsfeed Media Display
- **Diagnosis:** Newsfeed currently crops portrait/landscape images and multiple images are not shown in a grid. CSS/HTML and possibly PHP logic need updates in `newsfeed.php` and `assets/css/dashboard_style.css`.
- **Plan/Intended Fix:**
  - Update CSS for `.img-fluid` and media containers to use `object-fit: contain` for single images/videos.
  - For multiple images, use a flexbox or grid layout to show up to 4 images in a grid, with a "+N more" overlay if more than 4.
  - Ensure that clicking any media still opens the modal.
  - Test to ensure no regression in modal or other image displays.
- **Expected Outcome:** Newsfeed displays full images (portrait/landscape) and multiple images in a grid, without cropping. Modal functionality is preserved.

## Task 3: Share Button
- **Diagnosis:** Share button logic must use existing `original_post_id` and `is_share` columns. Must ensure privacy, correct display, and notification.
- **Plan/Intended Fix:**
  - Ensure backend (`api/share_post.php`) uses `original_post_id` and `is_share` columns.
  - In `newsfeed.php`, add a "Share" button for eligible posts.
  - Add a modal for sharing, allowing commentary and privacy selection.
  - When a post is shared, insert a new post with `is_share=1` and `original_post_id` set.
  - In the newsfeed, display shared posts with the sharer's comment and an embedded preview of the original post.
  - Add notification logic for the original author.
  - Test to ensure privacy and correct display.
- **Expected Outcome:** Share button works as described, shared posts display correctly, and original authors are notified.

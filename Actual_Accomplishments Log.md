## Follow Account Feature (Ongoing)

**Instructions:** Please provide your feedback below regarding the "Follow Account" feature implementation. Note whether the changes made (as documented in CHANGELOG.md by the AI agent) were successful in meeting the requirements from TaskLog.md, and if any issues were observed.

### AI Implementation Notes (Initial Setup - 2025-06-08):
*   **Database Schema:** An SQL script (`database_migrations/001_setup_follows_table.sql`) was created to set up/align the `follows` table schema to support `follower_id`, `followed_entity_id`, and `followed_entity_type`.
*   **Follow/Unfollow UI:**
    *   A "Follow"/"Unfollow" button has been added to `view_profile.php`.
    *   The button's state (Follow/Unfollow) is dynamically updated via an AJAX call to `api/toggle_follow.php`.
*   **Follower/Following Counts:**
    *   Follower and Following counts for the viewed user are now displayed on `view_profile.php`.
    *   The "Followers" count on `view_profile.php` dynamically updates after a follow/unfollow action.
*   **Newsfeed Integration:** The `newsfeed.php` script already contained logic to display posts from followed users. This has been verified conceptually but requires testing.
*   **2025-06-08 - Update:** Addressed an issue in `view_profile.php` where the initial follow status button and follower count were displayed incorrectly due to variable overwriting. Details of the fix are in `CHANGELOG.md`.
*   **2025-06-08 - Testing Completion:** All planned user-to-user "Follow Account" features (database, profile UI for follow/unfollow and counts, newsfeed integration) have been tested and are confirmed to be working. See `CHANGELOG.md` for details.
*   **2025-06-10 - `view_profile.php` Fixes:** Resolved issues with the initial display of the Follow/Unfollow button, "Followers" count, and "Following" count on `view_profile.php`. These elements now accurately reflect data on page load. Details in `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Follower/Following List Pages (2025-06-08):
*   **New Features:**
    *   Added methods `getFollowerList` and `getFollowingList` to `FollowManager.php` to retrieve paginated lists of followers and users being followed, respectively.
    *   Created `view_followers.php` to display a user's followers with pagination.
    *   Created `view_following.php` to display users someone is following, with pagination.
    *   Made follower/following counts on `view_profile.php` clickable links to these new dedicated list pages.
*   **2025-06-10 - Update (Item Layout):** Improved the layout of items on `view_followers.php` and `view_following.php` to use a multi-column card-style grid. Details in `CHANGELOG.md`.
*   **2025-06-10 - Update (Page Layout):** Corrected the overall page layout and styling for `view_followers.php` and `view_following.php` by rebuilding them based on the `friends.php` template. These pages now display correctly with the 3-column site theme. Stray HTML issue on `view_following.php` also resolved. Details in `CHANGELOG.md`.
*   **2025-06-10 - Functional Testing:** Successfully tested `view_followers.php` and `view_following.php`. Pages display correct data, links, and handle empty states. Pagination logic is present but could not be fully tested due to limited user data. Details in `CHANGELOG.md`.

    *   [Comment on `view_following.php` usability and correctness]

## Activity Feed Enhancements (`api/add_ons_middle_element.php`) - [Current Date, e.g., 2025-06-12]

**Goal:** Modify the sidebar Activity Feed to include activities "done to" friends and activities originating from media modal interactions (comments/reactions on media), in addition to existing activity types. Also, to ensure the feed itself is loading correctly.

**Debugging and Implementation Steps:**

*   **Initial Problem:** You reported that the sidebar Activity Feed was not updating with new comments or reactions, except for testimonial activities.
*   **Investigation:**
    *   I reviewed `api/add_ons_middle_element.php` and `api/add_ons_middle_element_html.php`.
    *   I identified that the original SQL queries were focused on activities *by* friends.
    *   You clarified the goal: to also see activities *to* friends by anyone, and to include activities from media modal interactions.
*   **Schema Discovery for Modal Activities:**
    *   You informed me that modal comments/reactions are stored in `media_comments` and `media_reactions` tables, not the main `comments` and `post_reactions` tables.
    *   I requested and received schemas for `media_comments` and `media_reactions`.
    *   I identified that `user_media.post_id` is the link from media items back to posts.
*   **Attempt 1: Complex SQL with 6 UNION ALL blocks (including media activities):**
    *   I provided a comprehensive SQL query for `$activity_sql` in `api/add_ons_middle_element.php` to unify 6 types of post/media activities.
    *   This attempt led to a series of SQL syntax errors reported by `pdo->prepare()`:
        *   Error 1: `Table 'nubenta_db.post_media' doesn't exist.`
            *   **Fix:** I corrected SQL JOINs to use `user_media` table instead of the assumed `post_media`.
        *   Error 2: `Unknown column 'pr.reaction_id' in 'field list'.`
            *   **Fix:** I corrected SQL to use `pr.id as event_id` as `id` is the PK for `post_reactions`.
        *   Error 3: Syntax error `near 'mc.content as comment_content...'` (missing comma in Block 5 of SQL).
            *   **Fix:** I added the missing comma.
        *   Error 4: Syntax error `near '' at line 218` (end of the 6-block SQL).
            *   This persisted even after individual blocks were tested successfully by you in phpMyAdmin.
        *   Error 5: Syntax error `near 'NULL as media_type, NULL as album_id, NULL as comment_content ...' at line 16` (Block 1 of the 6-block SQL).
            *   **Attempted Fix:** I corrected table aliasing in Block 1 (using `p.column` instead of `posts.column`). The error persisted.
*   **JavaScript `renderActivityItem` Debugging:**
    *   You reported VS Code flagging a red bracket in the `renderActivityItem` function I provided.
    *   I identified that unintended backslashes were being introduced in the code I sent.
    *   **Fix:** I re-provided `renderActivityItem` and helper functions using standard string concatenation instead of a single large template literal. You confirmed this fixed the VS Code error.
*   **PHP Parse Error (`ry {`):**
    *   I identified and corrected a typo (`ry {` instead of `try {`) in `api/add_ons_middle_element.php`.
*   **PHP Fatal Error (`bindParam on null` / `execute on null`):**
    *   I identified that `$activity_stmt = $pdo->prepare($activity_sql);` was missing before the parameter binding loop, or that the loop itself was commented out after I provided the large 6-block SQL.
    *   **Fix:** I instructed you to ensure `$pdo->prepare()` was called and the binding loop was active and correct for the number of parameters.
*   **Current Diagnostic Step (due to persistent SQL syntax error with the large query):**
    *   To simplify debugging of the `$activity_sql` in `api/add_ons_middle_element.php`, I proposed to test a **highly simplified version** of `$activity_sql` (containing only a minimal version of the first `SELECT` block for "Friend comments on any public post") to ensure `pdo->prepare()` can succeed with a basic query before rebuilding the more complex one.
    *   Your feedback is pending on this simplified test.
    
    ## Follow Account Feature

**Instructions:** Please provide your feedback below regarding the "Follow Account" feature implementation. Note whether the changes made (as documented in CHANGELOG.md by the AI agent) were successful in meeting the requirements from TaskLog.md, and if any issues were observed.

### AI Implementation Notes (Initial Setup - 2025-06-08):
*   **Database Schema:** An SQL script (`database_migrations/001_setup_follows_table.sql`) was created to set up/align the `follows` table schema to support `follower_id`, `followed_entity_id`, and `followed_entity_type`.
*   **Follow/Unfollow UI:**
    *   A "Follow"/"Unfollow" button has been added to `view_profile.php`.
    *   The button's state (Follow/Unfollow) is dynamically updated via an AJAX call to `api/toggle_follow.php`.
*   **Follower/Following Counts:**
    *   Follower and Following counts for the viewed user are now displayed on `view_profile.php`.
    *   The "Followers" count on `view_profile.php` dynamically updates after a follow/unfollow action.
*   **Newsfeed Integration:** The `newsfeed.php` script already contained logic to display posts from followed users. This has been verified conceptually but requires testing.
*   **2025-06-08 - Update:** Addressed an issue in `view_profile.php` where the initial follow status button and follower count were displayed incorrectly due to variable overwriting. Details of the fix are in `CHANGELOG.md`.
*   **2025-06-08 - Testing Completion:** All planned user-to-user "Follow Account" features (database, profile UI for follow/unfollow and counts, newsfeed integration) have been tested and are confirmed to be working. See `CHANGELOG.md` for details.
*   **2025-06-10 - `view_profile.php` Fixes:** Resolved issues with the initial display of the Follow/Unfollow button, "Followers" count, and "Following" count on `view_profile.php`. These elements now accurately reflect data on page load. Details in `CHANGELOG.md`.
*   **2025-06-10 - `view_profile.php` Styling:** Adjusted the display of Follower and Following counts to appear on a single line for an improved layout. Confirmed working by user. Details in `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Follower/Following List Pages (2025-06-08):
*   **New Features:**
    *   Added methods `getFollowerList` and `getFollowingList` to `FollowManager.php` to retrieve paginated lists of followers and users being followed, respectively.
    *   Created `view_followers.php` to display a user's followers with pagination.
    *   Created `view_following.php` to display users someone is following, with pagination.
    *   Made follower/following counts on `view_profile.php` clickable links to these new dedicated list pages.
*   **2025-06-10 - Update (Item Layout):** Improved the layout of items on `view_followers.php` and `view_following.php` to use a multi-column card-style grid. Details in `CHANGELOG.md`.
*   **2025-06-10 - Update (Page Layout):** Corrected the overall page layout and styling for `view_followers.php` and `view_following.php` by rebuilding them based on the `friends.php` template. These pages now display correctly with the 3-column site theme. Stray HTML issue on `view_following.php` also resolved. Details in `CHANGELOG.md`.
*   **2025-06-10 - Functional Testing:** Successfully tested `view_followers.php` and `view_following.php`. Pages display correct data, links, and handle empty states. Pagination logic is present but could not be fully tested due to limited user data. Details in `CHANGELOG.md`.

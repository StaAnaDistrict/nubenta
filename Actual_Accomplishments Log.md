## Activity Feed Enhancements (`api/add_ons_middle_element.php`) - [Current Date, e.g., 2025-06-12]

**Goal:** Modify the sidebar Activity Feed to include activities "done to" friends and activities originating from media modal interactions (comments/reactions on media), in addition to existing activity types. Also, to ensure the feed itself is loading correctly.

**Debugging and Implementation Steps:**

*   **Initial Problem:** You reported that the sidebar Activity Feed was not updating with new comments or reactions, except for testimonial activities.
*   **Investigation:**
    *   I reviewed `api/add_ons_middle_element.php` and `api/add_ons_middle_element_html.php`.
    *   I identified that the original SQL queries were focused on activities *by* friends.
    *   You clarified the goal: to also see activities *to* friends by anyone, and to include activities from media modal interactions.
*   **Schema Discovery for Modal Activities:**
    *   You informed me that modal comments/reactions are stored in `media_comments` and `media_reactions` tables, not the main `comments` and `post_reactions` tables.
    *   I requested and received schemas for `media_comments` and `media_reactions`.
    *   I identified that `user_media.post_id` is the link from media items back to posts.
*   **Attempt 1: Complex SQL with 6 UNION ALL blocks (including media activities):**
    *   I provided a comprehensive SQL query for `$activity_sql` in `api/add_ons_middle_element.php` to unify 6 types of post/media activities.
    *   This attempt led to a series of SQL syntax errors reported by `pdo->prepare()`:
        *   Error 1: `Table 'nubenta_db.post_media' doesn't exist.`
            *   **Fix:** I corrected SQL JOINs to use `user_media` table instead of the assumed `post_media`.
        *   Error 2: `Unknown column 'pr.reaction_id' in 'field list'.`
            *   **Fix:** I corrected SQL to use `pr.id as event_id` as `id` is the PK for `post_reactions`.
        *   Error 3: Syntax error `near 'mc.content as comment_content...'` (missing comma in Block 5 of SQL).
            *   **Fix:** I added the missing comma.
        *   Error 4: Syntax error `near '' at line 218` (end of the 6-block SQL).
            *   This persisted even after individual blocks were tested successfully by you in phpMyAdmin.
        *   Error 5: Syntax error `near 'NULL as media_type, NULL as album_id, NULL as comment_content ...' at line 16` (Block 1 of the 6-block SQL).
            *   **Attempted Fix:** I corrected table aliasing in Block 1 (using `p.column` instead of `posts.column`). The error persisted.
*   **JavaScript `renderActivityItem` Debugging:**
    *   You reported VS Code flagging a red bracket in the `renderActivityItem` function I provided.
    *   I identified that unintended backslashes were being introduced in the code I sent.
    *   **Fix:** I re-provided `renderActivityItem` and helper functions using standard string concatenation instead of a single large template literal. You confirmed this fixed the VS Code error.
*   **PHP Parse Error (`ry {`):**
    *   I identified and corrected a typo (`ry {` instead of `try {`) in `api/add_ons_middle_element.php`.
*   **PHP Fatal Error (`bindParam on null` / `execute on null`):**
    *   I identified that `$activity_stmt = $pdo->prepare($activity_sql);` was missing before the parameter binding loop, or that the loop itself was commented out after I provided the large 6-block SQL.
    *   **Fix:** I instructed you to ensure `$pdo->prepare()` was called and the binding loop was active and correct for the number of parameters.
*   **Current Diagnostic Step (due to persistent SQL syntax error with the large query):**
    *   To simplify debugging of the `$activity_sql` in `api/add_ons_middle_element.php`, I proposed to test a **highly simplified version** of `$activity_sql` (containing only a minimal version of the first `SELECT` block for "Friend comments on any public post") to ensure `pdo->prepare()` can succeed with a basic query before rebuilding the more complex one.
    *   Your feedback is pending on this simplified test.
*   **Sub-task 1.1: Simplify and Test Core SQL for Activity Feed (2025-06-13):**
    *   **Action:** Modified `api/add_ons_middle_element.php` to implement a drastically simplified SQL query.
    *   **Details:** The SQL query now *only* fetches "Friend comments on any public post". This was done to ensure `pdo->prepare()` works with a basic query and to establish a baseline for future activity feed enhancements.
    *   The PHP script was updated to correctly prepare and execute this new query, bind the necessary `:current_user_id` parameters, and process the results.
    *   Removed logic related to other activity types (reactions, social activities, testimonials) from the main feed query to isolate this specific functionality.
    *   The processing loop for `$all_activities` was simplified to match the structure of the new single query.
    *   **Outcome:** The backend script `api/add_ons_middle_element.php` is now streamlined for this one activity type. Verification of frontend display is pending user feedback.
*   **Sub-task 1.2: Incrementally Rebuild SQL for All Required Activity Types (2025-06-13):**
    *   **Action:** Modified `api/add_ons_middle_element.php` to incrementally add back several activity types to the feed's SQL query.
    *   **Details:**
        *   The base query from Sub-task 1.1 ("Friend comments on any public post") was used as a starting point.
        *   The following activity types were added sequentially using `UNION ALL`:
            1.  "Friend reactions on any public post": Fetches reactions by friends on any public post.
            2.  "Anyone comments on a friend's public post": Fetches comments by anyone on a public post made by a friend of the current user.
            3.  "Anyone reacts to a friend's public post": Fetches reactions by anyone on a public post made by a friend of the current user.
            4.  "Friend comments on media": Fetches comments by friends on media items linked to public posts. Includes media-specific details like URL and type.
            5.  "Friend reacts to media": Fetches reactions by friends on media items linked to public posts. Includes media-specific details and reaction type.
        *   For each step, careful attention was paid to:
            *   Consistent column aliasing across all `SELECT` blocks (e.g., `activity_id`, `activity_type`, `actor_user_id`, `target_owner_user_id`, `target_content_id`, `comment_content`, `reaction_type`, `media_id`, `media_url`, `media_type`, `activity_created_at`). `NULL` was used for columns not applicable to a specific activity type.
            *   Correct SQL table joins (`comments`, `post_reactions`, `media_comments`, `media_reactions`, `users`, `posts`, `user_media`, `reaction_types`, `friend_requests`).
            *   Updating PHP `bindParam` calls for new `:current_user_id` placeholders (total of 24 placeholders: `:current_user_id1` to `:current_user_id24`).
            *   Adjusting the PHP loop that processes `$fetched_activities` to correctly map data for each new activity type into the `$item` array for the JSON response. This included handling `media_url` prefixing and specific logic for `friend_name` based on context (e.g., for `comment_on_friend_post`, `friend_name` becomes the post author).
    *   **Outcome:** The `$activity_sql` in `api/add_ons_middle_element.php` now combines these 6 activity types. The overall query is ordered by `activity_created_at` and limited to 20 results. The PHP script is updated to support this expanded query. Frontend verification is pending.
*   **Sub-task 1.3: Update JavaScript Rendering Logic (2025-06-13):**
    *   **Action:** Modified the `renderActivityItem` JavaScript function in `api/add_ons_middle_element_html.php`.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Enhanced the `switch` statement within `renderActivityItem` to correctly handle the 6 activity types provided by the updated PHP backend: `comment`, `reaction`, `comment_on_friend_post`, `reaction_on_friend_post`, `media_comment`, and `media_reaction`.
        *   **Text Formatting:** Implemented specific text constructions for each activity type. For example:
            *   `comment`: "[Actor Name] commented on [Target Owner Name]'s post."
            *   `reaction`: "[Actor Name] reacted [Reaction Type] to [Target Owner Name]'s post."
            *   `comment_on_friend_post`: "[Actor Name] commented on your friend [Target Owner Name]'s post."
            *   `media_comment`: "[Actor Name] commented on [Target Owner Name]'s media."
        *   **Content Previews:** Added logic to display `activity.comment_content` (truncated) for comment-related activities.
        *   **Media Previews:** For `media_comment` and `media_reaction`:
            *   If `activity.media_url` exists and `activity.media_type` is 'image' or 'photo', an `<img>` thumbnail is displayed.
            *   If `activity.media_type` is 'video', a video icon is displayed.
        *   **Click Actions:** Ensured that clicking an activity item generally links to the relevant post using `viewPost(activity.post_id_for_activity)`. Actor names and target owner names are clickable and link to their respective profiles (`view_profile.php?id=...`).
        *   **Actor Images:** Included the actor's profile picture (`activity.actor_profile_pic`) next to the activity text.
        *   **Helper Function:** Added an `escapeHtml` function to sanitize text content before inserting it into HTML to prevent XSS.
        *   **Timestamp:** Used `activity.activity_time` (preferred) or `activity.activity_created_at` for display with `formatTimeAgo`.
        *   Retained existing cases for `friend_request`, `friend_connection`, and testimonials for broader compatibility, including a PHP fallback for `loggedInUserId` in testimonial rendering.
    *   **Outcome:** The `renderActivityItem` function in `api/add_ons_middle_element_html.php` is now equipped to render all 6 activity types with appropriate text, links, and previews. Frontend verification is pending.

## Task 2: Refining Newsfeed (Post Order) - 2025-06-14

**Goal:** Modify the main newsfeed to sort posts based on their last interaction time (latest comment or reaction) rather than just post creation time.

*   **Step 1-4: Identify, Analyze, Modify SQL, and Update PHP for Newsfeed Ordering:**
    *   **Identified Script:** `newsfeed.php` was identified as the primary script for newsfeed generation.
    *   **Analyzed Existing Query:** The script fetched posts from the user, friends, and followed users, ordered by `posts.created_at DESC`. It also had separate queries for "friend activities" and "social activities" which were merged and sorted in PHP.
    *   **Modified Main SQL Query in `newsfeed.php`:**
        *   The main post-fetching SQL query was updated to calculate `last_activity_at`.
        *   Added `LEFT JOIN comments c ON posts.id = c.post_id` and `LEFT JOIN post_reactions pr ON posts.id = pr.post_id`.
        *   Added `COALESCE(MAX(c.created_at), MAX(pr.created_at), posts.created_at) as last_activity_at` to the `SELECT` list.
        *   Updated the `GROUP BY` clause to include `posts.id` and all non-aggregated `users` table columns selected.
        *   Changed the `ORDER BY` clause to `last_activity_at DESC, posts.created_at DESC`.
    *   **Updated PHP Logic in `newsfeed.php`:**
        *   The initial `$all_posts` array is now directly populated by the result of the modified main query (`$posts`), which is already sorted by interaction time.
        *   A loop was added to assign `last_activity_at` or `created_at` to an `activity_priority` key for these posts, ensuring they can be correctly sorted if merged with other types of activities that use `activity_priority`.
        *   The existing PHP logic for fetching and merging separate `$friend_activities` and `$social_activities` was maintained.
        *   The final `usort` function was updated to correctly use `activity_priority` (which reflects `last_activity_at` for main posts) for sorting all merged items.
        *   The final `array_slice` to limit the total number of feed items to 20 was also kept.
    *   **Outcome:** The `newsfeed.php` script now primarily sorts posts based on their last interaction time (newest comment or reaction, or post creation if no interactions). The existing PHP-level merge of other activity types has been adapted to respect this new primary sorting order. Further refinement of the PHP merge logic might be needed depending on desired interaction between "post" items and "activity" items in the feed.
    *   **Step 5: Documentation:** Updated `Actual_Accomplishments Log.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` with details of the newsfeed ordering changes.

## Task 3: Refining Newsfeed (Media Display) - 2025-06-14

**Goal:** Improve the display of single images, multiple images, and videos within newsfeed posts for better visual presentation and consistency.

*   **Step 1-4: Identify Scripts, Analyze Rendering, Modify CSS & HTML Structure:**
    *   **Target Files:**
        *   `newsfeed.php`: For HTML structure of post media.
        *   `assets/css/dashboard_style.css`: For styling media elements.
    *   **CSS Modifications (`assets/css/dashboard_style.css`):**
        *   **Single Images/Videos:** Added/enhanced styles for `.post .media img.img-fluid` and `.post .media video.img-fluid` (and new helper classes `.single-media-item img/video`) to use `object-fit: contain`, a `max-height: 600px`, and `background-color: #f0f0f0` for letterboxing. This ensures the entire media is visible without cropping and doesn't become excessively tall.
        *   **Multiple Images (Grid):** Introduced new CSS classes for a flexbox-based grid:
            *   `.post-multiple-media-container`: Main flex container with `flex-wrap: wrap` and `gap: 4px`.
            *   `.media-grid-item`: Individual item container with `position: relative`, `overflow: hidden`.
            *   `.media-grid-item img/video`: Styled with `width: 100%`, `height: 100%`, `object-fit: cover` (to fill grid cells uniformly), and `cursor: pointer`.
            *   Added `data-count` attributes to `.post-multiple-media-container` (e.g., `data-count="2"`, `data-count="3"`, `data-count="4"`) to control `flex-basis` and `height` of grid items for different numbers of images (e.g., 2-per-row, specific layouts for 3 or 4 images).
            *   Added styling for `data-count-modifier="+"]` on the container and `data-more-count` on the last visible item to allow for a "+N more" overlay on the 4th image if more than 4 images exist.
    *   **HTML Structure Modifications (`newsfeed.php`):**
        *   In the post rendering loop, added logic to check if `$post['media']` (which is prepared by earlier PHP logic to be either a single path string or a JSON string of paths) contains a JSON array.
        *   If `$post['media']` is a JSON array:
            *   Decodes the JSON into `$media_items`.
            *   Renders a `<div class="post-multiple-media-container" data-count="X" data-count-modifier="Y">`.
            *   Loops through up to the first 4 `$media_items`.
            *   For each item, renders a `<div class="media-grid-item">` containing an `<img>` or `<video>` tag based on file extension.
            *   If there are more than 4 items, the `data-count-modifier` and `data-more-count` attributes are set on the container and the last item respectively, for the CSS "+N more" overlay.
            *   Ensures correct media paths are constructed (prefixing with `uploads/post_media/` if necessary).
        *   If `$post['media']` is not a JSON array (i.e., a single media item string):
            *   Renders the existing single media display logic within `<div class="media">`, ensuring `<img>` and `<video>` tags use the `img-fluid` class, which will now pick up the enhanced CSS for single media.
    *   **Outcome:** Newsfeed posts should now display single images and videos more consistently (contained within a max height, letterboxed if necessary). Posts with multiple images (up to 4) will display them in a responsive grid. If more than 4 images, the first 3 are shown in the grid, and the 4th grid item indicates there are more (e.g., "+2"). This provides a much-improved visual experience for media-rich posts.
    *   **Step 5: Documentation:** Updated `Actual_Accomplishments Log.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` with details of the media display changes.

## Task 4: Implementing Share Button - 2025-06-15

**Goal:** Add the backend and frontend components necessary for a post sharing feature.

*   **Sub-task 4.1: Database Modification:**
    *   **Objective:** Modify the `posts` table to support tracking shared posts and their originals.
    *   **Action:** Created a new SQL migration file `database_migrations/add_share_feature_columns_to_posts.sql`.
    *   **Schema Changes in Migration File:**
        *   `ALTER TABLE posts ADD COLUMN original_post_id INT NULL DEFAULT NULL;`: Added a nullable column to store the ID of the original post if the current post is a share. Assumed `posts.id` is `INT`.
        *   `ALTER TABLE posts ADD COLUMN post_type VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'original';`: Added a column to differentiate between 'original' and 'shared' posts.
        *   `ALTER TABLE posts ADD CONSTRAINT fk_original_post FOREIGN KEY (original_post_id) REFERENCES posts(id) ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE;`: Added a foreign key constraint. If an original post is deleted, shared posts referencing it will have `original_post_id` set to `NULL` (preserving the share itself).
        *   Added indexes on `original_post_id` and `post_type` for performance.
    *   **Outcome:** The database schema is prepared for the sharing feature. The migration file needs to be executed by the user to apply these changes to the database.
    *   **Documentation:** Updated `Actual_Accomplishments Log.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` (as part of this entry).
*   **Sub-task 4.2: Backend Logic (PHP) (`api/share_post.php`):**
    *   **Objective:** Implement the server-side logic to handle post sharing requests.
    *   **Action:** Modified the existing `api/share_post.php` script.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Changed input method from JSON to `$_POST` to align with typical form submissions and the subtask's conceptual snippet.
        *   Validated required inputs: `original_post_id` (integer). Optional inputs: `sharer_comment` (string), `visibility` (defaulted to 'friends', validated against allowed values).
        *   Used `$_SESSION['user']['id']` for `sharer_user_id`.
        *   Database operations are wrapped in a transaction (`beginTransaction`, `commit`, `rollBack`).
        *   **Original Post Verification:**
            *   Checks if the `original_post_id` exists in the `posts` table.
            *   Crucially, verifies that `original_post.post_type` is `'original'` (i.e., a post cannot be a share of another share).
            *   Includes basic accessibility checks for the original post (not 'only_me' if sharer is not owner; includes a placeholder for friend check if original is 'friends-only').
            *   Prevents users from sharing their own post without adding a comment.
        *   **Shared Post Insertion:**
            *   Inserts a new record into the `posts` table.
            *   `user_id` is set to `sharer_user_id`.
            *   `content` is set to `htmlspecialchars` of `sharer_comment` (or `NULL` if empty).
            *   `original_post_id` is set to the ID of the post being shared.
            *   `post_type` is explicitly set to `'shared'`.
            *   `visibility` is taken from user input or defaulted.
        *   **Response:**
            *   On success: Returns JSON `{'status': 'success', 'message': 'Post shared successfully', 'shared_post_id': new_post_id}`.
            *   On failure (validation, DB error, permissions): Returns appropriate JSON error messages and HTTP status codes.
        *   Includes `error_log` for exceptions.
    *   **Outcome:** `api/share_post.php` is now updated to process share requests according to the defined database schema (using `post_type`) and includes basic validation and error handling. More complex visibility/permission checks for sharing friends-only posts can be expanded if needed.
    *   **Documentation:** Updated `Actual_Accomplishments Log.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` (as part of this entry).
*   **Sub-task 4.3: Frontend UI (Newsfeed/Post Display):**
    *   **Objective:** Add Share button, Share modal, and logic to display shared posts in `newsfeed.php`.
    *   **Actions & Implementation Details:**
        1.  **Modified `newsfeed.php` (SQL Query):**
            *   The main SQL query was updated to `LEFT JOIN` with `posts orig_p` (original post) and `users orig_u` (original author) when `posts.post_type = 'shared'`.
            *   Selected necessary columns from `orig_p` and `orig_u` (e.g., `original_id`, `original_content`, `original_media`, `original_author_name`, `original_author_profile_pic`, `original_visibility`, `original_created_at`, `original_author_gender`).
            *   The `GROUP BY` clause was updated to include these new selected original post/author details.
        2.  **Modified `newsfeed.php` (PHP Post Formatting Loop):**
            *   The loop that prepares `$formatted_posts` was updated to include all the new `original_*` fields.
        3.  **Modified `newsfeed.php` (HTML Rendering - Share Button):**
            *   A "Share" button (`<button class="btn btn-outline-secondary share-btn" data-post-id="...">`) was added to the post actions area.
            *   This button is conditionally displayed only if `($post['post_type'] ?? 'original') === 'original'` and it's not a system message post (`!($post['is_system_post'] ?? false)`).
        4.  **Modified `newsfeed.php` (HTML Rendering - Share Modal):**
            *   The HTML structure for the share modal (`<div id="sharePostModal" class="modal">...</div>`) was added at the end of the `div.container`. It includes an area for original post preview (`#originalPostPreview`), a textarea for the sharer's comment (`#sharerComment`), a visibility select (`#shareVisibility`), and a "Share Now" button (`#confirmShareBtn`).
        5.  **Created `api/get_post_preview.php`:**
            *   This new PHP script takes a post ID (`$_GET['id']`).
            *   It fetches basic post details (author name, profile pic, content snippet, first media item) for 'original' posts.
            *   Includes basic visibility checks (similar to `api/share_post.php`) to ensure the user can view the post before showing a preview.
            *   Returns JSON with the post preview data or an error message.
        6.  **Overwrote `assets/js/share.js`:**
            *   The existing `assets/js/share.js` was overwritten with new logic to handle the share modal interactions.
            *   The new script uses event delegation to listen for clicks on `.share-btn`.
            *   When Share button is clicked: Retrieves `data-post-id`, fetches post preview using `api/get_post_preview.php`, populates `#originalPostPreview`, and displays the `#sharePostModal`.
            *   Handles modal close button and clicks outside the modal.
            *   Handles `#confirmShareBtn` click: Collects comment and visibility, makes an AJAX `POST` to `api/share_post.php`, and processes success/error responses (including attempting to refresh the feed).
            *   Includes an `escapeHtml` utility function.
        7.  **Modified `newsfeed.php` (Include JavaScript):**
            *   Added `<script src="assets/js/share.js" defer></script>` before the closing `</body>` tag.
        8.  **Modified `newsfeed.php` (HTML Rendering - Displaying Shared Posts):**
            *   In the main loop displaying posts (`foreach ($formatted_posts as $post)`):
                *   Added a check for `($post['post_type'] ?? 'original') === 'shared' && isset($post['original_id'])`.
                *   If true, it renders a specific structure for shared posts: sharer's info, sharer's comment, and an embedded preview of the original post (author, content, media, timestamp, visibility).
                *   A note was made about the complexity of fully enforcing original post privacy during shared post rendering, suggesting it as an area for future refinement if needed.
                *   If not a shared post, it renders the post as it did before.
    *   **Outcome:** The frontend components for initiating a share (button, modal, preview) and displaying shared posts (showing sharer and embedded original post) are now implemented in `newsfeed.php` and its associated JS. The main SQL query also supports fetching necessary data for shared posts.
    *   **Documentation:** Updated `Actual_Accomplishments Log.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` (as part of this entry).
*   **Sub-task 4.4: Notifications for Shared Posts:**
    *   **Objective:** Notify the original author when their post is shared.
    *   **Action:** Modified `api/share_post.php`.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   After a shared post is successfully inserted into the `posts` table and its new ID (`$shared_post_id`) is obtained:
            *   The `user_id` of the original post's author (`$original_author_id`) is retrieved from the `$original_post` variable (which was fetched earlier for validation).
            *   A check is performed to ensure `$original_author_id` is valid and is not the same as the `$sharer_user_id` (to prevent self-notification).
            *   If the condition passes, an `INSERT` statement is prepared for the `notifications` table.
            *   The notification details are:
                *   `user_id` (recipient): `$original_author_id`.
                *   `actor_id` (who performed the share): `$sharer_user_id`.
                *   `type`: `'post_share'`.
                *   `target_id`: `$shared_post_id` (ID of the newly created shared post).
                *   `link`: A URL pointing to the shared post (e.g., `../posts.php?id=$shared_post_id`).
            *   This notification insertion is wrapped in a `try-catch (PDOException)` block to log errors related to notification creation without failing the entire share operation if the notification insert fails.
    *   **Outcome:** When a post is shared, a notification record will be generated for the original author, assuming a `notifications` table with the specified columns exists and the existing notification display system can handle the new `'post_share'` type.
    *   **Documentation:** Updated `Actual_Accomplishments Log.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` with details of this notification logic.

*   **Sub-task 4.1 (Revised): Verify Existing Schema and Handle Incorrect Migration (Documented on 2025-06-15, relates to actions on/before this date):**
    *   **Objective:** Document the findings about the existing `posts` table schema and the status of the incorrect migration file.
    *   **Action:**
        *   Based on user feedback and `DESCRIBE posts` output, it was confirmed that the `posts` table already contains an `original_post_id INT(11) YES MUL NULL` column and an `is_share TINYINT(1) YES NULL DEFAULT '0'` column.
        *   These existing columns are suitable for the share feature, with `is_share` (1 for true, 0 for false) serving the purpose of the previously planned `post_type` ENUM/VARCHAR.
        *   The migration file `database_migrations/add_share_feature_columns_to_posts.sql` (created in the initial Sub-task 4.1) is therefore incorrect as it attempts to re-add `original_post_id` and a new `post_type` column. This file should be disregarded or deleted by the user.
        *   No *new* database schema changes are required for the core share functionality. The existing `original_post_id` is already indexed (as indicated by `MUL`). An index on `is_share` might be beneficial if not already present, but this was not part of the immediate correction.
    *   **Outcome:** The correct existing schema for shared posts (`original_post_id`, `is_share`) has been identified. The previously generated migration file is acknowledged as erroneous. Subsequent development for the Share Feature (Sub-tasks 4.2, 4.3, 4.4) was based on a `post_type` column; this logic will require revision in a future task to use `is_share`.
    *   **Documentation:** This entry in `Actual_Accomplishments Log.md` and a corresponding correction note in `CHANGELOG.md` serve as documentation of this finding.
*   **Sub-task 4.2 (Revised): Backend Logic Alignment with Existing Schema (2025-06-15):**
    *   **Objective:** Modify `api/share_post.php` to use the existing `is_share TINYINT(1)` column instead of the incorrect `post_type` column.
    *   **Action:** Updated `api/share_post.php`.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   The SQL query for verifying the original post was changed from `SELECT ..., post_type FROM ... WHERE ... AND post_type = 'original'` to `SELECT ..., is_share FROM ... WHERE ... AND (is_share = 0 OR is_share IS NULL)`. This correctly identifies posts that are not already shares.
        *   The subsequent PHP logic `if ($original_post['post_type'] !== 'original')` was effectively made redundant by the SQL change but the check `if ($original_post['is_share'] == 1)` (or similar logic based on the direct output of `is_share`) would be the conceptual equivalent if the SQL hadn't pre-filtered. The implemented SQL change is more efficient.
        *   The `INSERT` statement for creating the shared post was changed from `INSERT INTO posts (..., post_type, ...) VALUES (..., 'shared', ...)` to `INSERT INTO posts (..., is_share, ...) VALUES (..., 1, ...)`.
    *   **Outcome:** `api/share_post.php` now correctly interacts with the existing `is_share` column in the `posts` table, aligning the backend logic with the actual database schema for identifying original posts and creating shared posts.
    *   **Documentation:** Updated relevant sections in `Actual_Accomplishments Log.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
*   **Sub-task 4.3 (Revised): Frontend Alignment with `is_share` (2025-06-15):**
    *   **Objective:** Modify `newsfeed.php` (SQL query and PHP rendering) and `api/get_post_preview.php` to use the existing `is_share` column instead of `post_type`. Review `assets/js/share.js` for necessary adaptations.
    *   **Actions & Implementation Details:**
        1.  **`newsfeed.php` - SQL Query:**
            *   Changed `SELECT ..., posts.post_type, ...` to `SELECT ..., posts.is_share, ...`.
            *   Updated the `LEFT JOIN posts orig_p ON ... AND posts.post_type = 'shared'` to use `AND posts.is_share = 1`.
        2.  **`newsfeed.php` - PHP Formatting Loop:**
            *   Changed the assignment for the formatted post data from `'post_type' => $post['post_type'] ?? 'original'` to `'is_share' => $post['is_share'] ?? 0`.
        3.  **`newsfeed.php` - HTML Rendering:**
            *   The `data-post-type` attribute on the `<article class="post">` tag was updated to reflect 'shared' or 'original' based on the `is_share` value: `data-post-type="<?= ($post['is_share'] ?? 0) == 1 ? 'shared' : 'original' ?>"`.
            *   The condition for rendering a shared post's specific structure was changed from `if (($post['post_type'] ?? 'original') === 'shared' ...)` to `if (!empty($post['is_share']) && $post['is_share'] == 1 && isset($post['original_id']))`.
            *   The condition for displaying the "Share" button was changed from `if (($post['post_type'] ?? 'original') === 'original' ...)` to `if ((!isset($post['is_share']) || $post['is_share'] == 0) ...)` to correctly identify original posts.
        4.  **`api/get_post_preview.php`:**
            *   Changed the SQL query to `SELECT ..., p.is_share FROM posts p ... WHERE p.id = ? AND (p.is_share = 0 OR p.is_share IS NULL)`.
            *   Updated the JSON response to include `'is_share' => $post['is_share']` instead of `post_type`.
        5.  **`assets/js/share.js` Review:**
            *   Reviewed the script. No changes were necessary as it primarily uses `data-post-id` and does not rely on `post_type` from the preview data for its core logic (opening modal, submitting share). The conditional rendering of the share button itself is handled in `newsfeed.php`.
    *   **Outcome:** Frontend components (`newsfeed.php` SQL, PHP rendering, and `api/get_post_preview.php`) are now aligned with the existing database schema using the `is_share` column. `assets/js/share.js` did not require changes for this schema alignment. The share feature should now function more consistently with the actual database structure.
    *   **Documentation:** Updated `Actual_Accomplishments Log.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
*   **Sub-task 4.4 (Revised): Notification Logic Verification with `is_share` (2025-06-15):**
    *   **Objective:** Verify and ensure the notification logic in `api/share_post.php` correctly aligns with the use of the `is_share` column.
    *   **Action:** Reviewed `api/share_post.php`.
    *   **Verification Details:**
        *   The notification logic is triggered after a new shared post is created (which is now correctly marked with `is_share = 1` as per Sub-task 4.2 Revised).
        *   The notification `type` remains `'post_share'`, which is appropriate.
        *   The check to ensure the original post is not itself a share (i.e., `is_share = 0` or `NULL`) is performed *before* the new shared post (and thus the notification) is created. This ensures notifications are only for shares of original content.
    *   **Outcome:** The existing notification logic in `api/share_post.php` is compatible with the `is_share` schema modifications made in Sub-task 4.2 (Revised), as it correctly identifies the context of a share event. No code changes were required for the notification part itself in this sub-task.
    *   **Documentation:** Updated `Actual_Accomplishments Log.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` to reflect this verification.
    
    ## Follow Account Feature

**Instructions:** Please provide your feedback below regarding the "Follow Account" feature implementation. Note whether the changes made (as documented in CHANGELOG.md by the AI agent) were successful in meeting the requirements from TaskLog.md, and if any issues were observed.

### AI Implementation Notes (Initial Setup - 2025-06-08):
*   **Database Schema:** An SQL script (`database_migrations/001_setup_follows_table.sql`) was created to set up/align the `follows` table schema to support `follower_id`, `followed_entity_id`, and `followed_entity_type`.
*   **Follow/Unfollow UI:**
    *   A "Follow"/"Unfollow" button has been added to `view_profile.php`.
    *   The button's state (Follow/Unfollow) is dynamically updated via an AJAX call to `api/toggle_follow.php`.
*   **Follower/Following Counts:**
    *   Follower and Following counts for the viewed user are now displayed on `view_profile.php`.
    *   The "Followers" count on `view_profile.php` dynamically updates after a follow/unfollow action.
*   **Newsfeed Integration:** The `newsfeed.php` script already contained logic to display posts from followed users. This has been verified conceptually but requires testing.
*   **2025-06-08 - Update:** Addressed an issue in `view_profile.php` where the initial follow status button and follower count were displayed incorrectly due to variable overwriting. Details of the fix are in `CHANGELOG.md`.
*   **2025-06-08 - Testing Completion:** All planned user-to-user "Follow Account" features (database, profile UI for follow/unfollow and counts, newsfeed integration) have been tested and are confirmed to be working. See `CHANGELOG.md` for details.
*   **2025-06-10 - `view_profile.php` Fixes:** Resolved issues with the initial display of the Follow/Unfollow button, "Followers" count, and "Following" count on `view_profile.php`. These elements now accurately reflect data on page load. Details in `CHANGELOG.md`.
*   **2025-06-10 - `view_profile.php` Styling:** Adjusted the display of Follower and Following counts to appear on a single line for an improved layout. Confirmed working by user. Details in `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Follower/Following List Pages (2025-06-08):
*   **New Features:**
    *   Added methods `getFollowerList` and `getFollowingList` to `FollowManager.php` to retrieve paginated lists of followers and users being followed, respectively.
    *   Created `view_followers.php` to display a user's followers with pagination.
    *   Created `view_following.php` to display users someone is following, with pagination.
    *   Made follower/following counts on `view_profile.php` clickable links to these new dedicated list pages.
*   **2025-06-10 - Update (Item Layout):** Improved the layout of items on `view_followers.php` and `view_following.php` to use a multi-column card-style grid. Details in `CHANGELOG.md`.
*   **2025-06-10 - Update (Page Layout):** Corrected the overall page layout and styling for `view_followers.php` and `view_following.php` by rebuilding them based on the `friends.php` template. These pages now display correctly with the 3-column site theme. Stray HTML issue on `view_following.php` also resolved. Details in `CHANGELOG.md`.
*   **2025-06-10 - Functional Testing:** Successfully tested `view_followers.php` and `view_following.php`. Pages display correct data, links, and handle empty states. Pagination logic is present but could not be fully tested due to limited user data. Details in `CHANGELOG.md`.
